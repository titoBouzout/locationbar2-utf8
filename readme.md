LocationbarÂ² is an original software by Dao Gottwald.

Description:
<blockquote>This is a hacked version to allow editing of UTF8 URLs and to see more characters in an unencoded fashion.
Also shows real URLs (encoded) when clicked/selected.</blockquote>

Motivation:
<blockquote>From the very first version this add-on breaks UTF8 characters in the location bar, specially with parameters.
As I already fixed this many times, today I start this parallel project, hoping to get the fixes on original version.</blockquote>
