LocationbarÂ² is an original software by Dao Gottwald.</br>

Description:
<blockquote>This is a hacked version to support UTF8 URLs without breaking URLs.<br/></blockquote>


Motivation:<br/>
<blockquote>From the very first version this add-on breaks UTF8 characters in the location bar, specially with parameters.
As I already fixed this many times, today I start this parallel project, hoping to get the fixes on the original version.</blockquote>

Provides the following fixes:
<blockquote>
- It shows everything decoded, (more than original version).<br/>
- When selecting, it show real URL ( allows editing of parameters without breaking URL)<br/>
- Breadcrumbs works everywhere.<br/>
- Tooltip shows decoded.<br/>
